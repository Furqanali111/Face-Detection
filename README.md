# Face-Detection
# Introdution
As the world is advancing in Science and Technology, keeping security of oneâ€™s device is an important part of life, as all the information can be stored in the devices now days. After biometric the technology that is in mass use is the face recognition technology, it is currently being used to replace the biometric/fingerprint matching in technologies as face recognition can be fast and more efficient. Face recognition is also an important part to recognize criminals by matching their faces that has been captured by the CCTV camera.
# Objective
The main goal of our project is to learn how a face recognition system work using Eigen values, Eigen vectors and Singular value decomposition using MATLAB as an ide.
